# Pilot — Autonomous IT Management for MSPs & Internal IT Teams 🤖

Pilot is an agentic AI platform that autonomously manages IT operations to dramatically improve operational efficiency for Managed Service Providers (MSPs) and internal IT teams. Rather than relying on brittle, rules-based automation, Pilot uses specialized AI agents that reason, plan, and act — collaborating to reduce manual effort, reduce downtime, and accelerate routine operations.

Primary outcome: Enhanced Operational Efficiency — reduce manual toil, speed up remediation and patching, lower alert noise, and provide centralized visibility for safe, controlled autonomous actions.

## Why Pilot?
- Reduce alert fatigue and mean time to resolution (MTTR).
- Automate the full patch lifecycle with safety controls and rollback.
- Automate repetitive user and device operations to free engineers for higher-value work.
- Provide a single, auditable source of truth and control via a dashboard and APIs.

---

## Key Features & Outcomes
- Autonomous IT Management System with agentic AI.
- Automated & secure patch management with discovery, testing, policy enforcement, and rollback.
- Proactive alert management: noise reduction, automated triage, remediation, and continuous learning.
- Routine task automation: user lifecycle, software installs, self-service (password reset).
- Centralized AI Dashboard with widgets, workflow builder, deep-dive views, and automated root cause analysis (RCA).

## How Pilot Works (high level)
1. Observability & Inputs: Pilot ingests alerts, telemetry, inventories, and ticket events from integrated sources.
2. Agent Reasoning: Specialized agents interpret signals, reason about outcomes, plan actions, and coordinate with other agents.
3. Safe Execution: Actions are executed against targets (endpoints, servers, cloud) following policies, approvals, and pre-checks.
4. Learning Loop: Outcomes are recorded; feedback improves agent decisions (supervised / reinforcement signals).
5. Visibility & Governance: All agent actions, decisions, and telemetry are surfaced in a centralized dashboard and audit logs.

## Agent Details

### Patch Management Agent 🛡️
Capabilities:
- Automated discovery of missing patches across environments.
- Risk-aware testing and staged deployment (canary -> batch -> global).
- Policy-based scheduling (maintenance windows, blackout windows, device groups).
- Automatic rollback when post-patch health checks fail.
- Reporting and compliance artifacts for audits.

Operator controls:
- Patch policies (allowlist/denylist, approval gates).
- Emergency patch override.
- Manual intervention and audit trail.

Example policy (YAML):
```yaml
patchPolicy:
  name: "MSP-Default-Windows"
  maintenanceWindow: "Sun 02:00-04:00"
  approval: "auto" # or manual
  severityThreshold: "important" # critical, important, moderate
  rollbackOnFailure: true
```

### Alert Management Agent 🚨
Capabilities:
- Noise reduction through clustering, deduplication, and contextual enrichment.
- Automated triage: root cause hints, probable owner, suggested runbooks.
- Automated remediation for common, low-risk issues (service restarts, disk cleanup).
- Escalation workflows for uncertain or high-risk events.
- Continuous learning to improve classification and remediation choice.

Example behavior:
- If repeated identical alerts from a host => auto-cluster and run predefined remediation (e.g., restart service), then monitor for recurrence.

### Routine IT Task Agent ⚙️
Capabilities:
- User lifecycle automation (provisioning, deprovisioning, access entitlements).
- Automated software deployment and configuration orchestration.
- Self-service automation endpoints (password resets, certificate requests).
- Scheduled maintenance tasks (backup verification, certificate renewals).

Example flow:
- New hire request -> create user in directory, provision mailbox, add to groups, assign device or deployment task, create welcome ticket.

---

## Centralized AI Dashboard 📊
The Pilot Dashboard provides:
- Widgets: alert summaries, patch status, active automations, policy health.
- Deep dive pages: per-alert, per-host, per-agent timeline with actions and outcomes.
- Workflow Builder: visually create and test automations that agents can run.
- Audit & compliance views: action logs, approvals, policy history.
- RCA reports: automated root cause analysis for incidents with evidence and suggested preventative tasks.

---

## Security & Safety
Pilot is designed with safety-first principles:
- Least privilege: agents operate using scoped credentials and role-based access.
- Policy enforcement: admins define safe operational boundaries and maintenance windows.
- Approval gates: require human approval for high-risk actions or broad-impact changes.
- Immutable audit trails: all decisions and actions are recorded for compliance and postmortem.
- Secrets management: integrate with Vault/KMS for credential handling.
- Circuit breakers: halt or revert actions if error thresholds or unusual patterns are detected.

---

## Architecture & Suggested Tech Stack
Suggested components:
- Agent orchestration: microservices (Python/Go/TypeScript) running in Kubernetes.
- Message bus: Kafka or RabbitMQ for inter-agent events.
- Metadata & state: PostgreSQL (configs, policies), Redis (caching, locks).
- Telemetry & observability: Prometheus + Grafana, ELK or Loki for logs.
- Secrets & credentials: HashiCorp Vault or cloud KMS.
- Dashboard frontend: React / TypeScript.
- ML / Reasoning: combination of model hosting (PyTorch/TensorFlow) + LLMs or decision models for planning.
- Integrations: connectors for MS Teams/Slack, RMM tools, SIEMs, ticketing (ServiceNow/Jira), cloud providers.

## Getting Started — Quick Start
These are general steps to get a local/dev deployment running.

Prerequisites:
- Docker & Docker Compose (or Kubernetes + kubectl)
- Node.js (for dashboard), Python 3.10+ (for agents), or preferred runtime
- PostgreSQL / Redis (or use docker compose)
- Access to a secrets store (or local dev fallback)

Quick local setup (example using Docker Compose):
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/pilot.git
   cd pilot
2. Copy example env:
   cp .env.example .env
   # edit .env to set database passwords, API keys, dev credentials
3. Start services:
   docker compose up --build
4. Open Dashboard:
   http://localhost:3000
5. Initialize policies and seed data:
   ./scripts/seed-dev-data.sh

Note: This repo contains strong abstractions for production deployment (Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, operator CRDs). See /deploy for infra-specific instructions.

---

## Configuration & Policies
- Policies live as versioned YAML/JSON and can be applied per-tenant, per-group, or global.
- Policy examples include: patch windows, allowed remediation playbooks, agent escalation rules.
- Policies are auditable and change-controlled.

Example patch window:
```yaml
maintenanceWindow:
  timezone: "UTC"
  weekly:
    - day: "Sunday"
      start: "02:00"
      end: "04:00"
```

---

## APIs & Integrations
Pilot exposes:
- REST & GraphQL APIs for automation and data queries.
- Webhooks for event notifications.
- SDKs (reference implementations) for Python and TypeScript to build connectors and custom agents.
- Pre-built integrations: RMM, ticketing, monitoring, cloud providers, identity providers.

Sample API call (pseudo):
POST /api/v1/agents/patch/run
Body:
{
  "targetGroup": "windows-servers",
  "policy": "MSP-Default-Windows",
  "dryRun": true
}

---

## Observability & Testing
- Metrics: Prometheus metrics for agent health, action success/failure rates, reconciliation duration.
- Logs: Structured logs (JSON) with correlation IDs for traces.
- Tracing: OpenTelemetry instrumentation recommended.
- Simulators: synthetic telemetry generator for testing agent responses and safe rollback logic.
- CI: unit tests, integration tests (emulated targets), security scans, and policy tests.

## Roadmap
Planned & near-term items:
- Multi-tenant hardened deployment and onboarding flows for MSPs.
- Expanded connectors for top RMM platforms and cloud providers.
- More advanced predictive maintenance models (time-series failure prediction).
- Marketplace for community-contributed playbooks and integrations.
- Formal verification and policy simulation features.

---

## Troubleshooting
- If agents are not executing: check message bus connectivity and agent credentials.
- Patch failures: check rollback logs and health-check outputs for failing hosts, then isolate by canary group.
- Alert noise not improving: tune classification thresholds and feed historical incident outcomes to the learning pipeline.
